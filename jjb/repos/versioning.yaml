# DEPRECATED
# Note - transitioning to ONOS/Aether style one file and individual version
# jobs per repo, instead of the massive regex to match all repos
#
# This file exists only to handle the repos that haven't transitioned yet and
# are still in the regex

- project:
    name: versioning-jobs

    project: 'wildcard'
    project-regexp: '{version-tag-projects-regexp}'
