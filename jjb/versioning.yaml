# CORD versioning jobs for tagging/releasing software

# CORD versioning conventions:
#
# 1. There is a 1:1 relationship between SemVer _release_ versions described
#    in the commit and the git tag applied to that commit by Jenkins.
#
# 2. Non-release versions (ex: 1.0.1-dev3, etc.) can exist in multiple
#    commits, and don't trigger creation of git tags.
#
# 3. Git history is public, and therefore shouldn't be rewritten to abandon
#    already merged commits
#
# 4. Reverting a commit leaves it in history, so if a broken version is
#    released, the correct action is to make a new fixed version, not try to
#    fix the released version
#

      file and if so tags the commit in git with that same version.
