I am not sure if Hung had found a way to do it in a single Robot Testcase.  If we strictly want to have in a single test case then we should be adding a test scenario in `Voltha_PODTests.robot` file",

As an example of (1), I think it would be really nice if the basic sanity test looked something like:\n\nFOR    ${I}    IN RANGE    0    ${num_onus}\n        ${src}\u003d    Set Variable    ${hosts.src[${I}]}\n        ${dst}\u003d    Set Variable    ${hosts.dst[${I}]}\n        Authenticate RG    ${src}\n        Add Subscriber    ${src}\n        Get IP Address and Ping BNG    ${src}    ${dst}\nEND\n\nFor (2), can we move common functionality (e.g., Setup Suite) into Keywords that live in libraries?  Also the keywords above could live in a library that\u0027s imported by the other tests.",
