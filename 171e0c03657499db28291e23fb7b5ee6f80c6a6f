Large files can make identifying jobs and debugging difficult.\n  o To combat this files/branches are being refactored into smaller chunks, first pass involved creating a rough hierarchy with subdirs containing yaml configs named voltha-{2.8,2.10,2.11}.yaml.\n  o Refactoring steps:\n    - Copy master job (ugh: inconsistent, jobs should be branched but not all are).\n    - into {group}/voltha-2.11.yaml, voltha-2.12.yaml, ...\n    - ** Comment out original job in the monolithic config file until success for the new jobs has been verified.\n\nAny questions ?",
