When pkill attempts to kill a non-existent process ($? !\u003d 0) is returned which will prompt a job failure.\n\n--uid \u003cjenkins\u003e was passed to prevent another failure condition when forwarded procs are running not owned by user jenkins.\n\n--echo displays a list of processes killed (which can be used to match log entries down below).\n\n\nAlas this pkill call is old, can the patch make a call to pkill_proc instead ?\nWe have some issues going on with port forwarding and the script has added debugging (display procs prior to kill).\n\nhttps://gerrit.opencord.org/plugins/gitiles/ci-management/+/refs/heads/master/vars/pkill_proc.groovy",
