These scripts are run at boot time of a VM to configure it as a Jenkins minion.

See the upstream LF project for where they originated:

  https://gerrit.linuxfoundation.org/infra/gitweb?p=releng/global-jjb.git;a=tree;f=jenkins-init-scripts;hb=HEAD

Our versions differ from LF's in a number of ways:

- More secure SSH defaults
- Omit unneeded portions of the scripts

On bootstrap a script is provided as EC2 User Data that will pull down this
repo and run the init script. It should look like:

  #!/bin/bash

  # Clone the management repo
  git clone https://gerrit.lfbroadband.org/ci-management.git /ci-management
  /ci-management/jenkins-scripts/jenkins-init-script.sh

  # clean-up from the init run
  rm -rf /ci-management
