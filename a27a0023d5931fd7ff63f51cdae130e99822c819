      "message": "Branches were created by a one-off script, project \u0026 defaultremote are swapped due to explicit removal of values so they can be re-added with an updated values.\n\nAltering the branch that a patch will merge with by default seems like basic functionality for activity for branch creation.  If performed as a separate step that creates a window where people could push to master VS the actual branch.\n\nA chaser patch is on the way to suffix .git",

      "message": "If there is a reason to remove the .git in this commit, i am perfectly fine with that, as long as it is mentioned (inlcuding the reason) in the commit message. Reordering seems not necessary, but if your script still does that it should at least be mentioned in the commit message (including the reason). In general i do not have anything against minor style changes in commits, but those always make the review a bit harder, since it gets more difficult to spot the relevant change. For this one it is still easy enough, since there are only three lines involved.",
