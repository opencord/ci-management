      "message": "Branches were created by a one-off script, project \u0026 defaultremote are swapped due to explicit removal of values so they can be re-added with an updated values.\n\nAltering the branch that a patch will merge with by default seems like basic functionality for activity for branch creation.  If performed as a separate step that creates a window where people could push to master VS the actual branch.\n\nA chaser patch is on the way to suffix .git",

      "message": "If there is a reason to remove the .git in this commit, i am perfectly fine with that, as long as it is mentioned (inlcuding the reason) in the commit message. Reordering seems not necessary, but if your script still does that it should at least be mentioned in the commit message (including the reason). In general i do not have anything against minor style changes in commits, but those always make the review a bit harder, since it gets more difficult to spot the relevant change. For this one it is still easy enough, since there are only three lines involved.",

      "message": ".git suffix removal was an oversight:\n\nOriginal version of the script ran \"git remote -v show\" to query for repository name from (pwd\u003d\u003dsandbox).  This project value contains a \u0027.git\u0027 suffix.\n\nLater logic was generalized to accept a --repo argument and perform a clean checkout prior to branching.  Writing the the argument passed verbatim had a side effect of truncating the suffix.\n\nWe can retain the \u0027.git\u0027 suffix given this is a known/good value, that was not the overall intent.  Would have to verify gerrit/git is clever enough to infer the suffix before trying to prune it and simplify the string.\n\n\nAgreed on documenting/commenting why config line ordering was changed.",
